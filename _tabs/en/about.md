#### Welcome to 0hmsec blog!

The reason I created this blog is because I wanted to share various things about Cyber Security with all the Japanese people who are interested in Cyber Security. Of course, there are many cybersecurity blogs on the Internet. But the special feature of this blog is that it is written in two languages, Japanese and English.

#### Why have I used two languages?

1. There are lot of Japanese people out there who are interested in Cyber Security and also want to share various things with people all over the world. But having English as secondary language often proves to be difficult in situations where you want to convey your opinion and thoughts. Therefore, if you don't understand the right English word, you may feel stuck and you may give up the thought of sharing your opinion/thoughts. That's why I thought that writing important information in two lanuages might be of help to someone who really want to share their opinion/thoughts.

2. Two improve my own Japanese skills as well.
